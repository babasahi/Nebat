# 🧐 Project philosophy

Beatiful and fast Tic Tac Toe game built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

# 👨‍💻 Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the nebat app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Shared Prefrences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package which allows the app to read and write simple key-value pairs. Wraps NSUserDefaults on iOS and SharedPreferences on Android.
- The app uses the font ["UbuntuMono"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
